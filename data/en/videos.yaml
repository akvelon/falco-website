- title: 'Webinar: Kubernetes Runtime Security with Falco and Sysdig'
  description: As DevOps teams ramp Kubernetes in production, their responsibilities expand beyond monitoring, capacity management and troubleshooting to include security and compliance. Teams are looking to merge these two functions into a single secure DevOps workflow. It's time to think about runtime security and compliance requirements in the context of cloud native platforms.<br><br>In this talk, you will learn about detecting abnormal behavior and validate compliance in your running Kubernetes workloads using Falco, a CNCF project for runtime security. You will also learn how Sysdig Secure extends the Falco detection engine, offering the industry's first K8s-native threat prevention and incident response tool.

- title: 'Intro to Falco: Intrusion Detection for Containers - Shane Lawrence, Shopify'
  description: How do you protect Kubernetes clusters from malicious behavior? Role-based access control won't stop a user who's authorized to create pods from deploying hundreds of coin miners, and Intrusion Detection Systems at a network edge won't catch requests from a compromised container to the API server. Falco joined CNCF Incubator as an open-source runtime monitoring tool that combines kernel-level visibility with cluster-level awareness, making it possible to implement security policy and assert if these policies have been violated. In this session, Shane will demonstrate detection use cases, and discuss how Shopify has been using Falco since 2018 to monitor containers in a cloud environment that processes $100 million+ per day. Attendees will learn how to deploy Falco at scale, implement and change the ruleset, avoid common pitfalls with eBPF probes and kernel modules, and manage alert volume.

- title: 'Intro: Falco - Loris Degioanni, Sysdig'
  description: Host intrusion detection (HID) has been around for some time. What if we rethought the problems HID solves in the context of Cloud Native platforms? What if we can detect abnormal behavior in the application, container runtime, & cluster environment as well? In this talk, we’ll present Falco, a CNCF Sandbox project for runtime security. We will show how Falco taps Linux system calls & the Kubernetes API to provide low level insight into application behavior, & how to write Falco rules to detect abnormal behavior. We’ll show how to collect & aggregate alerts using an EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana). Finally we will show how Falco can trigger functions to stop abnormal behavior, & isolate the compromised Pod or Node for forensics. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of what problems runtime security solves, & how Falco can provide runtime security & incident response.
