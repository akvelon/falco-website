## What You Can Do with Falco

Falco shines at detecting threats, intrusions, and data theft at runtime and in real time. It works well with legacy infrastructures andbut excels at supporting containers, Kubernetes, and cloud infrastructures. It secures both workloads (processes, containers, services) and infrastructure (hosts, VMs, network, cloud infrastructure and services). It is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and scalable and to be used in both development and production. It can detect many classes of threats, but should you need more, you can customize it. It also has a thriving community that supports it and keeps enhancing it.

##### Secure your whole machine by instrumenting the operating system
One of the major benefits of Falco is its ability to provide host security. It achieves this by leveraging kernel-level instrumentation to capture low-level system events, such as file accesses, process creations, and network activity in the whole host where it runs. This allows Falco to detect suspicious behavior, such as unauthorized access attempts, malware infections, or privilege escalations, that may indicate a security breach. Additionally, Falco's rules engine can be customized to detect specific types of attacks and enforce security policies tailored to your organization's needs.

##### Protect your organization across the cloud
Falco offers a range of plugins that provide additional security benefits to organizations. These plugins integrate with various tools, such as Github and Okta, to enhance the security posture of your whole organization.

The Github plugin for Falco can detect unauthorized access attempts and anomalous activity within your code repositories. With this plugin, you can monitor user activity and detect suspicious actions, such as attempts to download sensitive code or make unauthorized changes.

Similarly, the Okta plugin for Falco can provide enhanced identity and access management capabilities. This can be particularly useful in the event of a security incident, such as the FireEye outbreak, where rapid alerting and response are crucial for containing the damage and mitigating the threat.

##### Protect containers, Kubernetes and cloud native applications
One of the primary benefits of using Falco is its ability to provide advanced container security. By tracking container behaviors and communications with the kernel with an eBPF probe or a native Kernel module, Falco can detect suspicious activities and threats in real-time. Falco can also enrich container events with metadata from the operating system, providing users with more context about what's happening in their containers.

In addition to container security, Falco also provides robust Kubernetes security capabilities. It can ingest audit logs generated by the Kubernetes control plane to detect unauthorized or malicious requests to the API. Falco can also identify changes in Kubernetes resources and configurations, allowing users to detect unauthorized modifications that could compromise the security of their environments. With Falco, users can be confident that their Kubernetes clusters are secure and protected against potential attacks.

##### Leverage runtime security in cloud environments
As more and more organizations migrate their applications to the cloud, the need for robust security measures becomes increasingly important. The nature of cloud-native environments can make it challenging to keep track of all the assets and configurations, which can expose infrastructure and applications to vulnerabilities.

Falco has powerful plugins that hook into the security event logs of your cloud provider of choice, and ensure that any unexpected or malicious behavior is detected and mitigated.

### Falco FAQs

The study was repeated with three brands of hand sanitizers containing 55%, 85%, and 95% ethanol. Their blood alcohol level was measured by gas chromatography 30 minutes after the last application.
An average healthy 7 year old boy weighs about 50 lb (23 kg). If we suppose the same amount of alcohol as in a 150 lb adult, that might amount to 3.1 to 6.0 mg/L in the child’s body—still far below an intoxicating effect.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
